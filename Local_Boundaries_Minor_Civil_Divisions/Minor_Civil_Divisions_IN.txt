  Description:
    Abstract:
      The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau
      pertaining to Minor Civil Divisions (MCD's):

      "Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)/Census County Divisions (CCds). MCDs are legally defined county subdivisions,
      such as towns and townships. In 21 states where MCDs do not exist or are not adequate for reporting subcounty
      statistics, the Census Bureau, in cooperation with state and local officials, delineates county subdivisions
      known as Census County Divisions."

      NOTE: Indiana does have MCDs, which are representative of civil townships.

    Purpose:
      MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.SHP was created to provide a GIS data layer of MCDs in Indiana, representative of
      civil townships.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      No formal metadata in the format of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
      was provided by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to the source data for this shapefile.

      The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau Web document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau
      pertaining to MCDs (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/cs_metadata.html#mcd):

      "Minor civil divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county or county
      equivalent in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental
      and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts,
      boroughs, charter townships, election districts, election precincts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts,
      parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts,
      towns, and townships. In some states, all or some incorporated places are not located in any MCD (independent places)
      and thus serve as MCDs in their own right. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they
      are located (dependent places), or the pattern is mixed- some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others
      are included within one or more MCDs. Independent cities, which are statistically equivalent to a county, also are
      treated as a separate MCD equivalent in states containing MCDs. In Maine and New York, there are American Indian
      reservations and off-reservation trust lands that serve as MCD equivalents; a separate MCD is created in each case
      where the American Indian area crosses a county boundary.

      The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in the following 28 states: Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
      Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
      New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia,
      West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the city of Washington is
      considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. Arlington County, VA, also has no MCDs and the entire county
      is designated as an MCD with the name Arlington.

      The MCDs in 12 states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
      Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can
      perform the same governmental functions as incorporated places. The U.S. Census Bureau presents data for these MCDs in
      all data products in which it provides data for places."

  Logical_Consistency_Report: No checks for logical consistency were made.
  Completeness_Report:
    The following is excerpted from the U.S. Census Bureau Web document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau
    pertaining to MCDs (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/cs_metadata.html#mcd):

    "County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and statistically equivalent entities for the
    reporting of decennial census data. They include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil
    divisions (including barrios and barrio-pueblos in Puerto Rico), and unorganized territories.

    Each county subdivision is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in
    alphabetical order within each state."

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        CS18_D00_E00.ZIP was downloaded from the USCB and unzipped. ESRI ArcToolBox was then used to convert the ESRI interchange
        file CS18_D00.E00 to an ESRI coverage named "MCD_IN." MCD_IN was then converted to a shapefile named MCD_IN.SHP.
        ESRI ArcToolBox "Define Projection Wizard" was then used on MCD_IN.SHP to define the projection provided, which was Geographic
        (Lat/Long) NAD83. ESRI ArcToolBox "Project Wizard" was then used to reproject to UTM Zone 16, NAD83, and the output shapefile
        was named MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.SHP. ESRI ArcMap was then used to edit the shapefile, and the following fields were
        dropped from the attribute table: "Area," "Perimeter," "MCD_IN_," "MCD_IN_I," "State," "LSAD," and "LSAD_TRANS."

        Two additional edits were made to the attribute table using ESRI ArcMap. Names of Indiana counties were added to a field
        named "Cnty_Name," using the "Join" function, and the field named "Name" was re-named as "MCD_Name."
