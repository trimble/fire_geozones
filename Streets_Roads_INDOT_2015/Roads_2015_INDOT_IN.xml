ROADS_2015_INDOT_IN.SHP is a line shapefile of Indiana roads, as provided by the Indiana GIS Department of Transportation (INDOT), Road Inventory Section. Data
were collected for the years 2006-2015.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source feature class named &quot;ROADS&quot;:

&quot;Indiana County Log Line Inventory created as an ESRI polyline shapefile consisting of a Feature polyline geometry. The data set was compiled by Road Inventory
of the Indiana GIS Department of Transportation (INDOT) . Dataset is classified as sde Feature Class. The Feature Class is projected Coordinate System: NAD 1983,
UTM, Zone 16 N. The Projections is Transverse Mercator.Each County Log Line Inventory is placed as to Position.(County Log is a utilized measurement from a
County Line intersecting with a Highway Network, for example Interstate, State and US. Measurement is from West to East and South to North). Position also
utilizes Jurisdiction, County, Road System, Route Name and Alternative RouteCounty Log line inventory is as of 2006-2015.&quot;
</abstract>
<purpose>
To provide an updated road network of Indiana in a GIS format.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source feature class named &quot;ROADS&quot;:

&quot;Displays map digitally of Indiana County Log line Inventory in a geospatial polyline format  The data was derived from pre-existing INDOT basemaps and
databases. The Data records as collected and described in the table is dated for the year 2006-2015.&quot;

IGS personnel received an ESRI shapefile named GIS_RDS.SHP from INDOT personnel on September 13, 2006.
GIS_RDS.SHP was loaded into ESRI ArcMap and examined for completeness, attribute accuracy, and spatial
accuracy. IGS Personnel then deleted the following atttribute fields: &quot;OBJECTID,&quot; &quot;CENSUS1,&quot; &quot;CENSUS2,&quot;
&quot;CFCC1,&quot; &quot;CFCC2,&quot; &quot;COUNTY,&quot; &quot;CTL,&quot; &quot;CTR,&quot; &quot;BLK90L,&quot; &quot;BLK90R,&quot; and &quot;ALTNAME.&quot; IGS personnel then saved the
shapefile as ROADS_2005_INDOT_IN. It should also be noted that portions of the associated metadata provided
by INDOT for GIS_RDS.SHP were extracted and included in this metadata file.
